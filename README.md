Cary: The program itself is currently extremely buggy. Odd behaviour from strtok it gives a lot of segmentation errors.
Buffers aren't freed at the end, leading to left over garbage used on next command (especially on command 1 being longer than command 2)

I will add more comments for proj2 via email.
